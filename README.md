# PocketUrl
WebApplication that makes very very long URL's short.\
Application is written in PHP, it uses MySQL as database.\
Create database with name **urlshort**. Than import **urlshort.sql**.
Change settings in helpers/database.php according to your mysql server.\
If you need - change config.php (has only one setting about installation folder).\
This is the first version, I will add many many functions.
